# Irrational Capital JPM DeepFin Demo and Presentation Materials

This repo contains the Irrational Capital DeepFin demo/presentation materials, and also notebook & data that participants can use for the session. 

The demo/presentation materials include slides and notebooks for the Intro and 4 breakout sessions. 
The Participant Notebook is not rendered so that participants can open it and render it themselves. Participants will get a chance to compare real human capital data aggregated from glassdoor.com and compare it to return streams for the S&P 100.
