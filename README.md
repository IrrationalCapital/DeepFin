# Irrational Capital DeepFin Participant Notebook

This repo contains the notebook and data that participants can use for the Irrational Capital DeepFin session. 

The Notebook is not rendered so that participants can open it and render it themselves. Participants will get a chance to compare real human capital data aggregated from glassdoor.com and compare it to return streams for the S&P 100. 

For any technical questions related to this notebook please reach out to Michael Chen (yc@irrational.capital) or Pete Melgren (pjm@irrational.capital).
